# User Story: Chat Demo Section

## Overview

**Title:** Interactive Chat Demo for Wandler Library  
**ID:** 001  
**Priority:** High

## User Story

**As a** potential user of the Wandler library,  
**I want to** see a live, interactive demo of the library's chat capabilities directly on the
landing page,  
**So that** I can understand how Wandler works in a real-world application without having to install
it first.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A new section on the landing page dedicated to the demo, with minimum dimensions of 100vh x 100vw
2. Visual indication of model loading process with progress tracking
3. Ability to select from at least one pre-configured model
4. Functional chat interface with:
   - Message history display
   - Text input for user messages
   - Send button
   - Visual indication of response streaming5
5. Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
6. Accessible UI with proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

## Technical Requirements

### Component Structure

1. **DemoSection** - Main container component (100vh x 100vw)

   - Title and description explaining what the demo shows
   - Model selection interface (dropdown or tabs)
   - Chat interface

2. **ModelLoader** - Component to handle model loading

   - Progress bar showing download status
   - Device selection (WebGPU, WASM, CPU)
   - Status indicators

3. **ChatInterface** - The actual chat UI

   - Message history display
   - Input area for user messages
   - Send button
   - Typing/streaming indicator
   - Clear conversation button

4. **MessageBubble** - Component for individual messages

   - Different styling for user vs. assistant messages
   - Support for markdown/code formatting
   - Timestamp

5. **FeatureHighlight** - Small informational cards that appear during the demo
   - Highlight privacy (data stays local)
   - Show performance metrics
   - Explain what's happening during model loading/inference

### Implementation Details

1. **Model Loading**

   - Use `loadModel` from Wandler with the `onProgress` callback
   - Store model in state once loaded
   - Show appropriate loading UI with progress information
   - Handle errors gracefully

2. **Chat Functionality**

   - Maintain conversation history in state
   - Use `streamText` for streaming responses
   - Implement typing indicators during streaming
   - Format messages with markdown support

3. **UI/UX Considerations**

   - Modern, clean chat interface with Tailwind styling
   - Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
   - Cyberpunk-inspired styling to match the existing site aesthetic
   - Animations for message transitions and typing indicators
   - Dark mode by default to match the site theme

4. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Lazy load the demo section to avoid impacting initial page load
   - Use React.memo for message components to optimize re-renders
   - Implement virtualized list for message history if it gets long
   - Clear model from memory when component unmounts

5. **Accessibility**
   - Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Add proper ARIA attributes
   - Maintain good color contrast
   - Add loading announcements for screen readers

## User Flow

1. User scrolls to the demo section
2. User sees a brief explanation of what the demo does
3. User clicks "Load Model" button
4. Progress bar shows model downloading and loading
5. Once loaded, the chat interface becomes active
6. User types a message and sends it
7. The response streams in real-time with a typing indicator
8. User can continue the conversation or clear it and start over
9. Informational tooltips appear at key moments to explain what's happening

## Technical Challenges

1. **Model Size and Loading Time**

   - Provide clear feedback during the potentially long loading process
   - Consider offering a smaller model option for faster loading

2. **Browser Compatibility**

   - Handle WebGPU availability detection
   - Provide fallbacks for browsers without required features

3. **Memory Management**

   - Ensure the model is properly unloaded when not in use
   - Monitor and display memory usage

4. **Error Handling**
   - Gracefully handle network issues during model download
   - Provide clear error messages if inference fails

## Dependencies

- Wandler library
- React and Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI components

## Notes

- The demo should be designed to work with minimal resources to ensure good performance on average
  devices
- Consider adding a disclaimer about initial loading times for the model
- Future enhancement: Add ability to switch between different models to compare
  performance/capabilities
